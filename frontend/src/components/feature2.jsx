                ulli allows you to select from four different vehicle sizes,
                depending on your needs. Picking the correct vehicle is
                important. Larger vehicles have a higher rate. However, if you
                select a vehicle that is too small for your job, it may require
                multiple trips, and you'll end up spending more than your
                estimate. Use the information on this page to pick the correct
                vehicle size for your project.

                    The box truck is the largest vehicle on GoShare's platform. Box
                    trucks typically range between 12 – 26 ft. Box trucks are ideal
                    for apartment moves, pallets, or multiple pieces of large
                    furniture.

                    Cargo Vans typically have a bed length between 10 and 14 ft. Cargo
                    vans provide the additional benefit of having an enclosed cargo
                    space, protecting your items against the weather. Cargo vans are
                    ideal for large pieces of furniture or moves that involve many
                    boxes, which can be stacked in the van's interior. Cargo vans can
                    also be used for a single pallet.
